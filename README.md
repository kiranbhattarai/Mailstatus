Email Status

While I was working at aloovi.com, we ran across the a problem. The problem was the emails that were sent from our servers were not tracked and we wanted to measure the number of people who were openning the emails Vs the number of people who were not even clicking on it. So with the help of PHP mailer and some custom script I was able to write a app that can be easily integrated in to any platform which will give you the details of the email status and their respective time stamp
